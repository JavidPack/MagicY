AutoY is a tool that runs alongside KMP editors to facilitate Y positioning of objects in a Mario Kart Wii custom course. Currently, it works with KMP Cloud. KMP Modifier, a program similar to KMP Cloud, already has an auto-y feature.

Usage is outlined in this forum post: http://www.mariokartwii.com/f101/magicy-kmp-cloud-auto-generated-y-coordinates-103337.html

There are two components, the autohotkey script which allows the use of a global hotkey (ctrl-y), and the python script, which does the y value calculations.

Python 2.7 is a current requirement, but hopefully I fix the codeso that it would work with either 2.7 or 3.x soon. Another possibility is rewriting the algorithm completely in the autohotkey script.

For compiling, autohotkey must be installed. (http://www.autohotkey.com/) From the start menu select the "Convert .ahk to .exe" option and set the input, output, and icon options and then click convert.
